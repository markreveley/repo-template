# audits/

A dated reading of the repo, or of one piece of it, against what it claims
to be: the code against its documents, the documents against each other, a
build against its spec. An audit lists what was checked, what held, and what
did not. What did not hold becomes issues (`../issues/`), one per finding,
and the audit links to them.

**Belongs here:** the scope, the method, the commit checked, every item
checked with its result, and the fixes that followed with their commits.

**Does not:** the fix itself (a PR), a finding on its own (`../issues/`), a
recommendation about direction (`../analysis/`).

**Names:** `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. A second audit of the same scope is a new
file that says what changed since the first.

**Form:** a header table (scope, commit, date, who or what ran it), then one
section per area with a table of items and results, then "Not checked".
